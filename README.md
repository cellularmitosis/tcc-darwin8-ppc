# tcc-darwin8-ppc

A Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger / PowerPC backend for [tcc](https://repo.or.cz/tinycc.git),
the Tiny C Compiler.

**Status: v0.2.5-g3 SHIPPED.** TCC has never had a PowerPC backend
in any release. As of session [027](docs/sessions/027-self-link/README.md),
the entire bootstrap chain runs without `gcc-4.0`: tcc compiles AND
links `tcc-self`, which compiles AND links `tcc-self2`, which
produces a `.o` byte-identical to what `tcc-self3` produces — the
canonical self-host fixpoint, on a 22-year-old G3 / G4. The
[v0.2.5-g3](https://github.com/cellularmitosis/tcc-darwin8-ppc/releases/tag/v0.2.5-g3)
patch release ([035](docs/sessions/035-unsupervised-2026-05-02/README.md))
adds **long-frame prolog/epilog** (>32 KB stack frames) and
**VLAs** on top of v0.2.4's struct-by-value/return work — bumping
`tests2` baseline to **101 / 122 (82.8%)**. A ~149 KB
`/opt`-installable tarball is built end-to-end by
`scripts/build-release-tarball.sh`.

## What this project is

TCC ships with backends for i386, x86_64, ARM, ARM64, C67, and
RISC-V64. **It has never had a PowerPC backend** in any release
(Bellard's, the 0.9.27 community release, or the active mob branch).
This project adds one, targeting 32-bit PowerPC on Mac OS X 10.4
Tiger Mach-O.

In addition to the codegen, this requires extending TCC's
`tccmacho.c` (currently hardcoded for x86_64 and arm64) to emit
32-bit PPC Mach-O object files and dyld-compatible executables.

## Why

- TCC compiles fast, in a place where everything else is slow.
  GCC takes minutes on a G3; even a quarter-functional TCC could
  meaningfully speed up small builds on the platform.
- Self-hosting a from-scratch compiler backend on a 22-year-old
  machine is fun.
- PowerPC ISA is genuinely pleasant — a fixed-size 32-bit
  instruction set with a clean RISC dispatch model.

## Building (G3 / G4, Tiger)

Primary dev host is **`ibookg37`** (300 MHz faster than the iMac G3
the project started on; both run Tiger 10.4.11 with the same gcc-4.0
+ libSystem + dyld).

```sh
ssh ibookg37
git clone <this-repo> ~/tcc-darwin8-ppc
cd ~/tcc-darwin8-ppc/tcc
./configure --config-semlock=no
/opt/make-4.3/bin/make           # system make is GNU 3.80, lacks $(or)
./tcc -B. -run hello.c           # works for "int main(void) { return N; }"
```

Notes:
- `--config-semlock=no` is required: tcc.h's `__APPLE__` branch
  hardcodes Grand Central Dispatch (10.6+); Tiger has POSIX
  semaphores only. The semlock feature isn't needed for our use.
- System `make` is GNU 3.80 (2002), which doesn't support `$(or
  ...)`. Use `/opt/make-4.3/bin/make` (preinstalled on the
  PowerPC fleet via `tiger.sh`).

## Building (uranium, host build for sanity check)

```sh
cd tcc
./configure
make -j8        # builds an arm64-osx tcc, has nothing to do with PPC
                # but confirms our patches don't break upstream targets
```

## Layout

```
tcc/                     - upstream mob source, modified in place. No
                           patch-set workflow. tcc/.UPSTREAM.md notes
                           the snapshot commit.
  ppc-gen.c              - PPC32 code generator (we wrote this).
  ppc-link.c             - PPC32 ELF relocation handling (we wrote).
  ppc-macho-stubs.c      - integration shims while tccmacho.c lacks
                           PPC support; deleted when phase 3 lands.

## License

Project code is MIT-licensed. The `tcc/` subdirectory inherits
upstream TCC licensing — LGPL 2.1 with most files MIT-relicensed
per [`tcc/RELICENSING`](tcc/RELICENSING). A handful of files
(notably `arm-gen.c`) remain LGPL-only; we don't copy from those.

See [`tcc/COPYING`](tcc/COPYING) and
[`tcc/RELICENSING`](tcc/RELICENSING) for upstream details.
